EXERCISE 1

Using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.

IF they say they are below 18, respond with: "Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off
IF they say they are 18, respond with: "Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!
IF they say they are over 18, respond with: "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"
